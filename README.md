# Basic-Javascript-Accordion

This is a very basic, super simple accordion UI component entirely built from scratch using plain Vanilla Javascript. There are no dependencies for this Javascript code snippet. Obviously code refactoring should be done to clean up some parts of the Javascript code which may be redundant, but perfection is not required at this stage.
